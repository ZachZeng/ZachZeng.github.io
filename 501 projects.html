				<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
				<i> <b> Decentralized process of course information management in all 19 schools in U-M </b> </i>
				<p class="body_text">
					To help students to make informed decisions when selecting courses, the Office of Academic Innovation (AI) launched <b>ART 2.0 (Academic Reporting Tools)</b>, which is a data visualization tool containing extensive course information. At present, all 19 colleges at U-M have their own decentralized processes for managing course descriptions. This situation, along with the sheer number of courses to keep track of at the University, creates challenges in maintaining accurate and up-to-date course descriptions within ART 2.0. Our team set out to find solutions to these challenges.

				<h3>Interview</h3>
				<p class="body_text">In order to identify the detailed workflows behind the management of course descriptions for each college, we scheduled interviews with 8 different departments that our client had listed as highest priority. Due to time constraints and scheduling conflicts with interviewees, we completed 6 of these interviews and gather information of the rest 2 schools through electronic communications.</p>

			<h3>Qualitative Analysis</h3>
			<p class="body_text">After each interview, our group conducted a <b>interpretation section</b> to transcribe the information we gathered from our notes and voice records. We discussed and extracted important ideas related to AI’s problem to build a set of data points, called <b>"affinity notes".</b> After obtaining all the affinity notes, we grouped them into lower-level categories based on underlying themes that we identified. We then added a summative sentence for each group and repeated the process to build upper-level categories. This process provided us a set of organized notes with clear hierarchical structure.</p>

			<h3>Brainstorm Solutions</h3>
			<p class="body_text">To resolve different issues exposed by our analysis, we brainstormed several potential solutions, such as <b>regular meetings </b> to enhance communication between AI and individual colleges, syncing ART 2.0 with LSA’s extensive shadow database, and creating a <b>unified online course approval system</b>. We also provide some additional recommendations based on our research that could help AI to increase the usage of ART 2.0. We have rated our recommendations based on difficulty and timeline to implementation.</p>
